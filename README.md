# Mighty Gecko LEUART and Bluetooth Module Project

This project contains low energy UART drivers, CC2640R2 bluetooth drivers, and application code to communicate wirelessly through the bluetooth module. 
Building off the SI1133 project, this application writes light data to the bluetooth module to be transmitted wirelessly to a bluetooth app on a phone. 

## Documentation
Included in this project is a compiled Doxygen report of all functions which can be found by downloading the "html" folder and opening index.html
